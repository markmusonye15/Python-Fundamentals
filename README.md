# Python Learning Project

A step-by-step learning journey through Python fundamentals.

## Overview

This repository contains code examples and notes for learning Python programming fundamentals. The content is organized by learning days, with each day focusing on specific concepts.

## Learning Progress

### Day One
- Installing Python
- Creating and running Python files
- Python comments and basic syntax

### Day Two
- Variables and their usage
- Data types (primitive and non-primitive)
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment)

### Day Three
- Control Flow statements:
  - If, if-else, elif conditions
  - Nested if statements
  - While loops
  - For loops
  - Break, continue, and pass statements
- Functions:
  - Function definition and calling
  - Return values
  - Parameters and arguments

### Day Four
- Data Structures:
  - Lists (creation, indexing, slicing, adding/removing elements)
  - Tuples (immutable collections)
  - Sets (unique collections)
  - Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
  - Range objects

## Getting Started

To run these examples, you need Python installed on your system. You can run any of the Python files using:

```bash
python app.py
# or
python day_two.py
# or
python day_three.py
# or
python day_four.py
```

## Examples

The repository includes practical examples like:
- Basic printing and calculations
- Variable assignment and manipulation
- Rectangle calculator (user input, calculations, and output)
- Control flow demonstrations with loops and conditionals
- Function definitions with various parameter types
- Data structures implementation and manipulation
